# Instructions for Agents

## Build Artifacts & Dynamic Files
* **Do not commit changes** to files in `config-lib/src/main/assets/tslFiles/` (e.g., `EE.xml`, `eu-lotl.xml`). These files are updated dynamically by build scripts (like `TSLXMLDownloader.py`). If you run these scripts locally for testing, **revert the changes** to these files before submitting.
